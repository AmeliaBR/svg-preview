SVG Preview for Brackets
==========
Add an inline live preview panel when viewing SVG files. The preview updates in real time as you type. Works great with [Everyscrub](https://github.com/peterflynn/everyscrub)!

Click the swatches at top to choose a background color for the preview. Use the +/- buttons to zoom and the "0" button to reset to 100% scale.
